## 📖 Overview
**Battle Tactics Arena** is a **2D turn‑based strategy prototype** built in **Lua with the LÖVE2D framework**.  
It was developed as my **final project for Harvard’s CS50x Intro to Computer Science**, and serves as both a technical milestone and a creative playground.

The game features:
- Grid‑based tactical combat
- Distinct character classes (ninja, paladin, mage, ranger, etc.)
- Action Point (AP) economy
- Attack, heal, dodge, and miss mechanics
- Animated sprites and effects powered by `anim8` and `Timer`

## 🎯 Why It Matters
This project demonstrates:
- **Game architecture**: modular state management (`menu`, `inGame`, `main`)
- **Scripting & automation**: Lua logic for turn order, AP, and combat resolution
- **UI/UX design**: stat windows, buttons, turn indicators, and feedback animations
- **Problem‑solving**: implementing tactical RPG mechanics from scratch

👉 This repo highlights my ability to **design systems, debug complex interactions, and document gameplay logic**—skills directly transferable to IT support, automation, and software development.

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
- Lua scripting & LÖVE2D game framework
- Animation handling with `anim8`
- Time‑based events with `Timer`
- Modular state management
- Clear documentation & branding

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [LÖVE2D](https://love2d.org/) (version 11.3+ recommended)

### Run the Game
```bash
love .
```

---

## 🎮 Gameplay
- **Pass & Play**: Two players alternate turns on the same machine
- **Action Points**: Spend AP to move, attack, or heal
- **Victory Condition**: Eliminate all opposing units
